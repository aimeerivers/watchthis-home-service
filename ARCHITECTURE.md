# WatchThis - Architectural Plan

_Share media with friends - YouTube videos, music, articles, and more_

## Vision

WatchThis aims to solve the problem of sharing media content with friends by providing a dedicated platform where users can share videos, music, articles, and other media into their friends' "inboxes". When content is consumed, it gets marked as watched, creating a clean and organized way to share and track media consumption among friends.

## Event-Driven Architecture

### Core Events

```typescript
// Media Events
interface MediaCreatedEvent {
  type: "MEDIA_CREATED";
  mediaId: string;
  userId: string;
  url: string;
  metadata: MediaMetadata;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// Sharing Events
interface MediaSharedEvent {
  type: "MEDIA_SHARED";
  shareId: string;
  fromUserId: string;
  toUserId: string;
  mediaId: string;
  message?: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}

interface MediaWatchedEvent {
  type: "MEDIA_WATCHED";
  shareId: string;
  userId: string;
  mediaId: string;
  watchDuration?: number;
  timestamp: Date;
}

// User Events
interface UserRegisteredEvent {
  type: "USER_REGISTERED";
  userId: string;
  email: string;
  timestamp: Date;
}
```

### Event Flow Examples

#### Sharing Workflow

1. User shares media â†’ `MediaSharedEvent`
2. Inbox Service receives event â†’ Updates recipient's inbox
3. Notification Service receives event â†’ Sends notification
4. Analytics Service receives event â†’ Records sharing activity

#### Watch Workflow

1. User marks as watched â†’ `MediaWatchedEvent`
2. Sharing Service updates share status
3. Analytics Service records consumption
4. Notification Service may notify sharer

## Database Strategy

### Service-Specific Databases

#### User Service - MongoDB

```javascript
// User collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  username: String,
  email: String,
  passwordHash: String,
  profile: {
    displayName: String,
    avatar: String,
    preferences: Object
  },
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### Media Service - MongoDB

```javascript
// Media collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  url: String,
  platform: String, // 'youtube', 'spotify', 'article', etc.
  metadata: {
    title: String,
    description: String,
    thumbnail: String,
    duration: Number,
    author: String,
    publishedAt: Date
  },
  extractedAt: Date,
  createdBy: ObjectId, // User ID
  createdAt: Date
}
```

#### Sharing Service - MongoDB

```javascript
// Shares collection
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  mediaId: ObjectId,
  fromUserId: ObjectId,
  toUserId: ObjectId,
  message: String,
  status: String, // 'pending', 'watched', 'archived'
  watchedAt: Date,
  createdAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```

#### Inbox Service - MongoDB

```javascript
// Inbox items (denormalized for performance)
{
  _id: ObjectId,
  userId: ObjectId,
  shareId: ObjectId,
  mediaId: ObjectId,
  media: {
    title: String,
    thumbnail: String,
    platform: String,
    url: String
  },
  sharedBy: {
    userId: ObjectId,
    displayName: String,
    avatar: String
  },
  message: String,
  status: String,
  isRead: Boolean,
  readAt: Date,
  sharedAt: Date,
  updatedAt: Date
}
```
